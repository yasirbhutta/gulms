To add a course:

1. Click **New course** in the category page on the right
Click on the category where you want your course to be.

1. Click the **"New course"** link

1. Enter the course settings, and then choose either to **"Save and return"** to go back to your course, or **"Save and display"** to go to the next screen.

On the next screen,if you have chosen "Save and display", choose your students/teachers to assign to the course.
